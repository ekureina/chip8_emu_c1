First attempt at a Chip8 emulator, written in C.

Inspiration from http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/ for some of the Chip8 knowledge.

Horribly written code, but I'm proud of the amount of time it took, and I'm releasing it under the GNU GPL v3 or any later version for anyone to see some interesting C.
